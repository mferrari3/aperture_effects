<h1>Aperture effects in Galaxy Mass Estimation</h1>

One of the most widely used Galaxy Mass catalogues,
the MPA-JHU catalog relies on SDSS spectra and SDSS
photometry to constrain galaxy masses.

The SDSS spectra are taken using optic fibers with
an angular diameter of 180 micrometers, i.e. spanning 3 arcseconds
in the sky.Thus the spectra are obtained for only a fraction
of the galaxy.
